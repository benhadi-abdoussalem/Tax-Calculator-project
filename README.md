# Tax-Calculator-project
The Tax Calculator currently runs as a manually deployed static application and lacks a robust pipeline in place. This epic focuses on modernizing the application to deploy it on IBM Cloud1. But the web application will not just be simply lifted and shifted to cloud. The application will be containerized using Docker container2. The deployment will be managed through a pipeline, which will also ensure that all unit tests pass4 before deployment.
The following hints will help you create relevant user stories in the next Task:

Deploying on IBM Cloud

Containerizing the application

Creating pipeline for packaging the application

Running unit tests as part of pipeline
